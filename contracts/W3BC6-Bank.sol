contract Bank {

        - Deposit => user can pay into their account
        - withdraw => user can withdraw from their account
        - get_users_balance => user can view their account balance
        - get_bank_balance => the contract owner can view the total amount in the bank 
        - transfer => user can transfer funds to another account
        ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
        improvements:
        - use fallback/receive method
        - separate contracts: one for bank, and the other for user
        - apply DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) to withdraw and transfer_to_address functions
        - check against 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address for transactions
