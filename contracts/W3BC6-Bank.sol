        - Deposit => user can pay into their account
        - withdraw => user can withdraw from their account

        improvements:
        - use fallback/receive method
        - separate contracts: one for bank, and the other for user
        - apply DRY(Don't Repeat Yourself) to withdraw and transfer_to_address functions
        - check against 0x0000000000000000000000000000000000000000 address for transactions
